#Set variables to make a sea level projections with "main.ncl"
#
# Description of variables:
# INFO: Set to true to get more info in output
# LOC: If True, local otherwise global sea level projection
# IBarE: If True, include the inverse barometer effect, only used for local 
#        projections. But not necessary (generally small effect).
# TEMPf: Chose which models to read GMST from. 
# Possible choices: "AR5": same models as for IPCC AR5
#                   "all": all CMIP5 models available
# GRE: Greenland dynamics and surface mass balance
# Possible choices: "IPCC": RCP8.5 is different from other scenarios
#                   "KNMI14": Dynamics for all scenarios the same (average of both 
#                             IPCC values)
# ODYN: Option for Ocean Dynamics
# Possible choices: "IPCC" can only be used for global analysis (read file 
#                   distributed by AR5)
#                   "KNMI" use data from KNMI14 scenaios. Can be used for both 
#                   local and global but only for RCP4.5 and RCP.8.5. For global
#                   "IPCC" option is preferable.
#                   "CMIP5" uses data computed directly from the CMIP5 database.
#                   It can be used for both local and global computations. These 
#                   input files should be computed before running the sea level 
#                   projection.
# ANT_DYN: Antarctic dynamics
# Possible choices: "IPCC" for AR5 process based 
#                   "KNMI16" for Rijkswaterstaat project
#                   "DC16"   DeConto and Pollard 2016
#                   "DC16T"  DeConto and Pollard 2016 with with temperature sensitivity
#                   "LEV14"  Levermann et al. 2014, only the 3 ice shelves models
# GAM: Uncertainty of climate models
# Possible choices: 1 for IPCC AR5
#                   1.64 to convert the IPCC expert judgement that the 5-95 
#                   percentiles from climate models is the likely range.
# COMB: Combination of sea level contributors 
# Possible choices: "IPCC" Follows the normal IPCC way to combine processes
#                   "IND"  Assume complete independence
#                   "DEP"  Assumes complete dependence (correlation = 1 )
# Corr: Set True to compute the Pearson and Spearman correlations between sea level 
#       contributors. Increases the computing time significantly. Correlation between
#       contributors is always used in the model but not necessarily computed. This
#       option does not change the results but adds some diagnostics.
# CorrGT: Correlation between the GMST and thermal expansion, default is 1 for 
#       IPCC AR5. Around 0.6 for local Dutch Coast. Global between 0.3 (RCP4.5) and
#       0.47 (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), see 2017 report for RWS about these correlations.
#       The value of CorrGT is overwritten by COMB if COMB is IND or DEP.
# CorrM: Correlation measure of CorrGT. Can be either "Pearson" or "Spearman"
# CorrSMB: If True, correlate some model uncertainty from the glaciers, Greenland 
#          SMB and Antactic SMB.
# CorrDYN: If True, correlate the Antarctic and Greenland dynamics, only applies
#          to "LEV14" case
# NoU_O: If True, removes ocean uncertainty. Replace the distribution by its 
#        expected value.
# NoU_G: If True, remove Greenland uncertainty.
# NoU_A: If True, remove Antartic uncertainty.
# NoU_Gl: If True, remove Glacier and ice caps uncertainty
